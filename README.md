# BC Ferries App
This is a web application that provides real-time information about BC Ferries. Users can filter the ferries departing after a certain time, view percentage occupied, and view more details about the sailing schedule. The user interface is interactive and user-friendly.

# Features
- Real-time ferry information from BC Ferries API.
- Search feature for finding ferries departing after a specified time.
- User-friendly and interactive interface with a button to hide or show the full list of ferries.
- Cards that display ferry information, including the vessel name, departure time, percentage occupied.
- Hover effect on cards that shows more details about the sailing schedule.
- Logo refresh feature that reloads the page when clicked.
- Take Me to Top button for easy navigation.

# Technologies Used.
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create the user interface.
- BC Ferries API was used to retrieve the ferry information.
- The application was built using asynchronous JavaScript with async and await functions for better performance.

# Searching ferry
- **The web app only searches for ferries from current day since API does not provides the date of departure.
